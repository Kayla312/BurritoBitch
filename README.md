# BurritoBitch
BurritoBitch is a burrito logger utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) following the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL, BurritoBitch queries and routes data, and uses Handlebars to generate  HTML.

## Function of the app
•    BurritoBitch! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burritos they would like to eat. 

•    Whenever a user submits a burrito's name, the app will display the burrito on the left side of the page -- waiting to be consumed. 

•    Each burrito in the waiting area also has a Consume it! button. When the user clicks it, the burrito will move to the right side of the page. 

•    Your app will store every burrito in a database, whether devoured or not.
